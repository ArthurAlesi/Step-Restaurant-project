### Concept 

The purpoise was to build a restaurant site using HTML. My project has a a dropdown menu(menu from html) , a page with the menu restaruant, a registering form and a sign in section. <br>
Because i made a "halloween-restaurant" I tried to used the colors of halloween. Black, and orange mainly. That's the reason of the visual identity.
